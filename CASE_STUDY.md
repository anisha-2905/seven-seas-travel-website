# **Project Overview**

When **SevenSeasTravel**, a small travel agency, approached me, they had something powerful—great travel packages and real experience—but **no website at all**.

No online presence. No digital trust. No way for travelers to discover them.

My role was to take the brand **from zero to a fully live, functional website** that could communicate trust, clarity, and excitement—especially to first-time visitors.

This project wasn’t just about visuals. It was about **building credibility for a real business** using design and technology.

# **My Role**

I worked as the **sole designer and developer**, responsible for:

- Client requirement analysis
- Information architecture and layout decisions
- Web design and interaction flow
- Building and deploying the website using Framer
- Responsive optimization and final launch

# The Core Problem

The challenge wasn’t “make a website.”

The real problem was **visibility and trust**.

- Travelers couldn’t find the agency online.
- The business had limited content, which risked making the site feel empty or unreliable.
- Multiple destinations and packages needed structure, not clutter.
- The website had to look professional while still triggering curiosity and wanderlust.

In short, I had to **design confidence from nothing**.

# My Design Thinking & Process

## **Step 1: Understanding the Business, Not Just the Design**

I started with conversations, not screens.

I focused on understanding:

- What kind of travelers they serve
- What emotions they wanted users to feel
- What information matters *before* someone contacts a travel agency

The goal became clear:

*Make users feel safe enough to trust, and excited enough to explore.*

## **Step 2: Designing with Speed and Intent**

Instead of static wireframes, I chose **Framer** to work directly in a real, interactive environment. This allowed me to:

- Iterate quickly
- Test layouts while designing
- Adjust content structure based on flow, not assumptions

To avoid confusion, I structured the website around:

- **Domestic destinations**
- **International destinations**
- **Packages and special offers**

I intentionally kept interactions minimal—enough to feel modern, not overwhelming.

## **Step 3: Building, Testing, and Launching**

I built the entire website in Framer, focusing on:

- Clear navigation paths
- Responsive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile
- Simple user journeys (explore → understand → contact)

Every design decision came back to one question:

**“Will a first-time visitor know what to do next?”**

# **The Outcome**

- A **fully live website** was successfully launched
- The agency gained an online identity they didn’t have before
- Travelers can now explore destinations and packages with ease
- The client approved the design with minimal revisions, showing alignment with their vision

Most importantly, the website is **actively usable**, not just a concept.
